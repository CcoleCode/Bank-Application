# Bank-Application


This application allows the user to perform regular ATM functions(deposit, withdrawal, check balance, and accrued interest calculation). By importing the scanner library, this program accepts a user input after presenting a menu of options. 
The way that this program currently runs, it requires the user to make a deposit in order to start with a balance. 

To run this program please download the source code via the src files and compile using a JRE.

This was a class assignment that I completed for my Full Stack Development Apprenticeship with Xpanxion.

If you have any suggestions on how I might be able to build upon or improve this program, I am open to receiving feedback!

Thank you,
